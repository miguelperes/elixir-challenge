# Elixir Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/miguelperes/elixir-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/miguelperes/elixir-challenge) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/miguelperes/elixir-challenge/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/miguelperes/elixir-challenge?branch=master)
Elixir project made for the [Stone Tech Challenge](https://github.com/stone-payments/tech-challenge)

## About

The idea of the project is to create a set of tools to handle monetary operations, such as transfering money between accounts and currency conversion.

#### The `Money` struct: floating point rounding issues
The [Money](http://elixir-stone-challenge-doc.surge.sh/FinancialSystem.Money.html) structure is generated by receving values in two ways: as a string representation (e.g.: `"15.75"`) or separating its major part (dollar or reais, for example) and minor part (cents/centavos) as integers (e.g.: `15` and `75`). And of course its currency as an `atom` (must be compliant with ISO 4217).  
After that, this value is internally converted to a [Decimal](https://hexdocs.pm/decimal/readme.html), and all further arithmetic operations are done in Decimal (which uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic), to avoid floating point arithmetic issues.

#### Currency conversion
The `currency_rates.txt` file contain all the exchange rates (taken from [Open Exchange Rates](openexchangerates.org)) on 01/31/2018. It is parsed and transformed into a Keyword list, and then used in the conversion. Alternatively, a conversion can be made passing a value and some arbitrary conversion rate.

## Usage

### Installing
`mix deps.get` to install dependencies  
`iex -S mix` to start Elixir's interactive shell

### Testing / Quality
`mix test` to run unit tests  
`mix coveralls` to check test coverage  
`MIX_ENV=test mix coveralls.detail` to show code coverage details  
`mix format` to format the code ensuring proper style (`.formatter.exs` rules)  
`mix credo` to run credo  
`mix dialyzer` to run dialyxir static code analysys  

## Documentation
[Access online documentation here](http://elixir-stone-challenge-doc.surge.sh/)  
`mix docs` to generate up to date documentation (at `doc/index.html`)

## Code Quality
Tools used to ensure code quality and proper styling during development:

- The [Elixir Formatter](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2018/01/17/elixir-v1-6-0-released/) (v1.6+) is being used to ensure the code is compliant with the language style guide;
- [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo) is a static code analysis tool that is being used to ensure code quality (checking for refactor opportunities, warning about commom mistakes, duplicated code, etc);
- [ExCoveralls](https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls) is a coverage report tool with coveralls.io integration;
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/miguelperes/elixir-challenge/) is being used for Continuous Integration, executing tests and sending a report to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/miguelperes/elixir-challenge) each time a branch is pushed. The `master` branch is protected, which means that only branches that passed all Travis checks will be able to be merged to it;
- Dialyzer ([Dialyxir](https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir)) is being used for static code analysis providing warning about problems in the code that are commonly detected by static languages (such as type mismatches) based on the functions `typespec`.
